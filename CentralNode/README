CentralNode
-----------
Node connected to the computer via USB.
Node address: 868 Mhz, net group 5, node 30.
Local sensors: - outside temperature (DS18B20)
               - barometric pressure (BMP085)
Receives:      - electricity readings (from SensorNode)
               - gas readings (from SensorNode)
               - inside temperature (from GLCDNode)
Sends:         - electricity actual usage (to GLCDNode)
               - outside temperature (to GLCDNode)
               - barometric pressure (to GLCDNode)
               - all values to USB for webpage
               - all values to cosm.com via Ethercard
Other:         - 2x16 LCD display (to display electricity usage & outside temperature)
	       - Uses an Ethercard to send readings to cosm.com
	       - commands to get/set eeprom sensor settings of the SensorNode:
			(NOTE: get/set is possible via the serial interface of the Arduino IDE)
			gtst,.		get/display all the sensor min and max settings
			emnl,<value>.	set minimum trigger of left electricity sensor to <value>
			emxl,<value>.	set maximum trigger of left electricity sensor to <value>
			emnr,<value>.	set minimum trigger of right electricity sensor to <value>
			emxr,<value>.	set maximum trigger of right electricity sensor to <value>
			gmin,<value>.	set minimum trigger of gas sensor to <value>
			gmax,<value>.	set maximum trigger of gas sensor to <value>
			wmin,<value>.	set minimum trigger of water sensor to <value> (Not used yet)
			wmax,<value>.	set maximum trigger of water sensor to <value> (Not used yet)
				accepted values for <value> = 1 -> 1023
